# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm which is known for its better time complexity and using 'divide and conquer' to break down the problem into smaller ones and solve them recursively. Implementing some known algorithms lets you understand a programming language better and makes your familiar to usual patterns.
